          Iâ€™ve had experience with many tools and technologies, but my current
          stack is TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB. Based on these
          experiences, I am currently working on various projects. <br /> <br />{' '}
          My goal as a Web Developer is to create a bridge between a product and
          its users. I build this brigde that has experiences and stories that
          people can empathize and interact with. I am currently open for Web
          Development positions. <br />
